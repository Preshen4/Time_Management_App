Title: POE Part1 ST10083954


Description: 

The project is used to help students manage their times and recommend how many hours they should spend studying a module per week.	
This application was created in Visual Studio using C# and WPF.
A library called ModulesCal is added into the project. This library was created by me.

References: 
1} A nuget package called MahApps.Metro.IconPacks.Material was used in this project for the use of icons.
